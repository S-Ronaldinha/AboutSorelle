		<h3>Food packing, Feeding South Florida</h3>
		<p>A lot of people in the USA suffer from food insecurities,which means,they</p>
		do not know when their next meal is going to be,and/or are not even sure if </p>
		they are going to have a meal for the day. As a recurrent volunteer at Feeding</p> 
		South Florida, I ran  through the donated food stock, checking expiration dates,</p> 
		and repackaging so they could ship it to those in need.</p>
